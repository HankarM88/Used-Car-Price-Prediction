## Used Price Prediction with Machine Learning

In this project, we aim to estimate the pricing value of used cars using machine learning. The model was trained on a collected dataset of used car price from [Avito](https://www.avito.ma/). We used Streamlit framework to deploy the application for end users in the cloud. 

### Features
- Predicts prices of used cars based on its features such as mileage, brand, and fuel type.
- Provides an intuitive interface via Streamlit for user input and prediction.
- Uses machine learning  to estimate used car prices with an accuracy of 88 %.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HankarM88/Used-Car-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Future Enhancements
- Adding more features to improve the model accuracy.
- Integrating with other APIs for real-time data updates.
- Adding more data to avoid overfitting
