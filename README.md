## Used Price Prediction with Machine Learning

In this project, we aim to estimate the pricing value of used cars using machine learning. The model was trained on a collected dataset that contains used car prices from [Avito](https://www.avito.ma/). We used Streamlit framework to deploy the application for end users in the cloud. 

### Features
- Predicts prices of used cars based on its features such as mileage, brand, and fuel type.
- Provides an intuitive interface via Streamlit for user input and prediction.
- Uses machine learning  to estimate used car prices with an accuracy of 88 %.
